# Front-end of late-checker

## What is it?

This is a **ReactJs** the web-app that allow you to **see**, **add** and **delete* users from the system. You can also **watch** the **video feed**.

## Which technologies?

In this **ReactJs** web-app, we used:
* **Styled Component** to manage the **css** *(the style)*.


## How to run it?

To run the project you will need to have node installed on your computer.
Then you need to **install all the decencies**. For that, just launch in your terminal:

```bash
sudo npm install
```
*Notes: This will run a **development** version and this is **not optimized for the production**.*

When everything is installed, you can simply **run the app** and a tab be opened in your default browser.
To **run the app**, just type this in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```


## You can also find some other commands there:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
